          I am a UI/UX developer with a strong eye for detail, a solid technical
          foundation in frontend development, and a deep understanding of
          business needs. I bridge the gap between design and implementation,
          crafting user-focused interfaces and bringing them to life with clean,
          scalable code.
        </p>
        <p>
          By combining creativity, technical expertise, and business insights, I
          deliver intuitive, accessible, and impactful solutions that align with
          both user and business goals. Letâ€™s create exceptional digital
          experiences together!
